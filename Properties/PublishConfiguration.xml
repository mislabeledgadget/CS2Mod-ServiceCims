# Service Cims - Park Volunteers (for now)

Version 1.0.* of this module is focused solely on the Parks Department. The purpose of this mod is to maintain parks that can't be reached by Parks Department vehicles, either because they exist on remote islands and can only be access via ferry, or because they only are accessible via pedestrian paths. This module will recruit unemployed, teen/adult students, retirees, and criminals to become park volunteers for the day and restore maintenance at parks and clean up it's trash. They will take whatever means of transportation available to them to reach the park.

The park volunteer will announce via Chirper, allowing you to click on both the cim and the park. (Thanks to @ruzbeh0. for their awesome CustomChirps module and API).

The cim will show VOLUNTEERING AT {name of park} on his cim info window.

## Settings:**
1. Dispatch Interval in minutes - how often we check for parks that need maintaining. (1-60 minutes)
2. Max volunteers per dispatch - up to how many cims (1 per park) we will send out to restore a park's maintenance and clean up it's trash. (1-50)
3. Min Failure Count - how many failures the park must have before it's considered a qualifying park. Parks with a lot of failures most likely aren't being reached by Park Maintenance vehicles. (3-50)
4. Maintenance Threshold (%) - What the park maintenance level must be under to qualify for a park volunteer. (0-70%)

## **Technical notes:**
1. Filters out cims that have jobs, sleeping, sick, dead, or sending out mail.
2. Queries 10 qualifying cims for each park, and picks the closest one.
3. This park also maintains a list of current park volunteers and parks with park volunteers enroute so that they don't get picked again.
4. Watches for cims that fail their route (usually because of route cost exceeding what's tolerable), or never left their starting point, and unassigns them.
5. Clears park and cim from list once it's been maintained and sends the cim home.
